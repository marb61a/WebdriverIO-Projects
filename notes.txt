Setup WebdriverIO (WDIO)
    - NPM will need to have been initialise in a project folder by the time WDIO is being installed
    - To install WDIO using the following command
        - npm install --save-dev @wdio/cli
    - Following the installation a config file will have to be generated
        - npx wdio config
        - npx runs npm packages without needing to have paths etc 
    - This will generate a list of options which must be selected through
        - This covers from base url to where the tests will be ran so this will change depending on circumstances of testing
